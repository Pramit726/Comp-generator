## Project Overview

This Streamlit application, powered by Google GEMINI 1.5 Pro, generates comprehension exercises based on user input of topics, keywords, and desired question types. Users have the flexibility to specify the number of multiple-choice, short answer, and long answer questions according to their preferences. Moreover, users can conveniently download the generated content in the form of text and PDF files, enhancing accessibility and offline usage.

The application incorporates robust logging and exception handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and error detection. Additionally, a setup module is implemented to streamline the installation process and manage dependencies effectively.

Deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the application offers easy access and utilization for users. AWS also ensures scalability, allowing the application to handle varying user loads seamlessly.
